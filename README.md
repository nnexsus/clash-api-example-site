*Clash of Clans database api*

Hi. While I was working on my CoC discord bot, I realized there was no good clash of clans database for army or building stats.
So, I've made one. It's free to use and doesn't need a signup or key, just make a request and you're set.

At the time of uploading this it is army only, I'll add buildings in a short future update.
Also, I don't believe I will be adding stats for the Builder or Capital halls, but that may change.


Check out the example (doc) site here:
